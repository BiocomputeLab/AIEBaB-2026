<p>We're living through a revolution. AI and engineering biology are colliding to unlock capabilities that seemed impossible just years ago. From designing new to nature proteins in silico to programming living cells like software, and accelerating discovery at breathtaking speed. This isn't incremental progress. This is transformation. Join us in Bristol where pioneers, researchers, and innovators converge to share breakthroughs, challenge boundaries, and shape what comes next. The future is being built now, so come join us and become part of it!</p>

<h2 id="venue">Venue</h2>

<p>Bristol stands at the intersection of scientific innovation and creative thinking, making it the perfect home for this edition of AI, Engineering Biology and Beyond. This vibrant city in southwest England has an extraordinary engineering legacy that continues to inspire today's pioneers. It was here that Isambard Kingdom Brunel created some of his most audacious works --- the SS Great Britain, the world's first iron-hulled, screw propeller-driven ocean liner, still sits majestically in Bristol's harbour as a testament to engineering ambition. The city's skyline is also graced by Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, a masterpiece of Victorian engineering that spans the dramatic Avon Gorge. In the 20th century, Bristol became synonymous with aerospace innovation as the birthplace of Concorde, where engineers pushed the boundaries of what was possible in supersonic flight. This spirit of bold, transformative engineering, spanning maritime to aerospace, echoes perfectly with today's revolution in AI and biological engineering.</p>

<p>Today, Bristol is experiencing a deep tech renaissance. The city has become a magnet for AI startups, synthetic biology companies, and quantum computing ventures, supported by world-class research at the University of Bristol and significant investment from both venture capital and government innovation funds. This explosion of deep tech activity has created a dense network of researchers, entrepreneurs, and engineers working at the frontiers of technology --- exactly the community driving conversations about AI, engineering biology, and what lies beyond.</p>

<p> The conference will take place at the main campus of the University of Bristol, a short walk from Bristol Temple Meads train station and approximately a 30 min taxi ride from the airport.</p>
